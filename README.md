# Patrick Prémartin

As a freelance trainer and developer, I offer a wide range of online resources in the form of open source projects, videos and blogs.

Between streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin), I can train you in the languages I use (Delphi, Object Pascal, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) or contribute to the creation and development of your software (desktop or mobile) and websites (back offices, API servers, SaaS, etc.).

If you need training (for your company, association, school, or other organisation) or technical support, or if you would like to offer me a project or job, please contact me using [this form](https://olfsoftware.fr/contact/) or [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickpremartin/).

For questions, suggestions, or reports concerning my open source projects, please open a ticket on the relevant code repository.

And if you want to discuss projects, development, or other things, [join me on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) when I'm online.

## Help me to do more!

To support my online activities and publish more content, there's no miracle solution: I need money.

You can contribute by making a one-off or monthly donation via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/patrickpremartin), where you'll receive exclusive content in return.

You can also support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/patrick_premartin_en), [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/PatrickPremartin), or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/DeveloppeurPascal).

Follow [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) if you have an account (whether you watch me or not). It will boost my stats!
And if you have an Amazon Prime subscription, use your option to [subscribe to my channel](https://www.twitch.tv/subs/patrickpremartin) each month. It won't cost you anything.

You can also purchase licences for [my softwares](https://store.olfsoftware.fr), web scripts and [Pascal libraries](https://store.developpeur-pascal.fr), buy one of the latest [mugs and goodies](https://goodies.medianim.com/search?query=delphi) available, or of course [offer me work](https://olfsoftware.fr/contact/) (a mission or ‘real’ job, as long as it doesn't conflict with the distribution of my existing software and services).
