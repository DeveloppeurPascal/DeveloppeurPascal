Hello

Basically I'm a video game developer :video_game: (at least that's how I saw myself when I was coding on my TO7-70 in 1984) but since then I've gone wrong! :confounded:

Since then I've done a lot of things, but I'm still focused on content creation (videos, articles, courses, books, [Twitch streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin)), [training for companies](https://olfsoftware.fr/c/_20-formation.html) or individuals, providing services (technical support, one-off web or Delphi development) and [publishing software](https://olfsoftware.fr/c/_1_-logiciels-et-utilitaires.html), [video games](https://gamolf.fr), [mobile applications](https://olfsoftware.fr/c/_13-applications-mobiles.html), [scripts](https://olfsoftware.fr/c/_10-scripts.html) and [libraries](https://olfsoftware.fr/c/_12-librairies-et-composants-delphi.html).

To find out more, discuss it, or offer me assignments, [check out these links](https://vasur.fr/gravatar) or my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickpremartin/).

Happy coding!

Patrick

## Where to start ?

Between repositories related to webinars, conferences, training courses or books, repositories of libraries and components, repositories of video games, utility software or mobile applications, you've got plenty to do around here. One day I'll launch a search engine or document it all outside [blog devlogs](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/devlog.html).

These repositories serve as the basis for almost all my others:

* [DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component) : a non-visual component for VCL and FMX to display an “about” dialog box on all platforms supported by Delphi
* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) : Pascal units for a little bit of everything
* [DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine) : the toolbox for VCL video games such as FireMonkey

And you have templates and starter kits that evolve according to my needs on other projects:

* [DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Projects-Template](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Projects-Template) : to have a “blank” code repository with basic files as for my code repositories
* [DeveloppeurPascal/FMX-Tools-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/FMX-Tools-Starter-Kit) : to get a FireMonkey project starter kit supporting translations, styles, document management
* [DeveloppeurPascal/Gamolf-FMX-Game-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Gamolf-FMX-Game-Starter-Kit) : to get a FireMonkey video game starter kit with real games as examples

Some projects are grouped into sub-modules of theme packs, of which [here's the list](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal?tab=repositories&q=pack&type=&language=&sort=). This can make it easier to find things or to [download all at once](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects).

Lost in GitHub or don't know how to use git? Start with [this video](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/manipulations-git-et-github-de-base.html).

## Support

If you feel like it and if finances allow, support my work here and elsewhere. These links are also available on each of my repositories:

* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/DeveloppeurPascal)
* [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/PatrickPremartin)
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/patrickpremartin)
* [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/patrickpremartin)
* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/subs/patrickpremartin) (If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you're entitled to one SUB on a Twitch channel per month. It's included in your Prime subscription, it doesn't cost you anything extra and it can be a great help for streamers. Go ahead, use it!)

If you need an invoice or accounting proof, use GitHub, Patreon or Twitch.

You can also [contact me directly](https://olfsoftware.fr/contact/) to offer me a training assignment (web or Delphi development), technical assistance or one-off development work. I can also advise you or help you use anything I distribute here or elsewhere.

If you'd like to read, see or listen to some content, why not [access Zone Abo](https://zone-abo.fr), where you'll find my entire online archive (courses, articles, videos, ebooks, etc.).

If you prefer goodies, I still have a few mugs for sale [exclusively on this site](https://goodies.medianim.com/search?query=delphi).

As my main goal is to make a living from this open source+streaming activity between two missions as a service provider, your donations, license purchases and especially your [Zone Abo subscriptions](https://zone-abo.fr/nos-abonnements.php) are essential.
