# Where to start with my open source projects?

Between repositories related to webinars, conferences, training courses or books, repositories of libraries and components, repositories of video games, utility software or mobile applications, you've got plenty to do around here. One day I'll launch a search engine or document it all outside [blog devlogs](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/devlog.html).

These repositories serve as the basis for almost all my others:

* :speech_balloon: [DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component) : a non-visual component for VCL and FMX to display an “about” dialog box on all platforms supported by Delphi
* :file_folder: [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) : Pascal units for a little bit of everything
* :video_game: [DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine) : a toolbox for VCL video games such as FireMonkey

And you have templates and starter kits that evolve according to my needs on other projects:

* :runner: [DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Projects-Template](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Projects-Template) : to have a “blank” code repository with basic files as for my code repositories
* :construction_worker: (WIP) [DeveloppeurPascal/FMX-Tools-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/FMX-Tools-Starter-Kit) : to get a FireMonkey project starter kit supporting translations, styles, document management
* :video_game: [DeveloppeurPascal/Gamolf-FMX-Game-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Gamolf-FMX-Game-Starter-Kit) : to get a FireMonkey video game starter kit with real games as examples
* :construction_worker: (WIP) [DeveloppeurPascal/VCL-Tools-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/VCL-Tools-Starter-Kit) : to get a VCL project starter kit supporting translations, styles, document management

Some projects are grouped into sub-modules of theme repositories, of which [here's the list](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal?tab=repositories&q=pack&type=&language=&sort=). This can make it easier to find things or to [download all at once](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects).

Lost in GitHub or don't know how to use git? Start with [this video](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/manipulations-git-et-github-de-base.html) or the links under it.
